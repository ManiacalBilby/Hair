# Hair Appointment Integration Record

### Overview

For my fourth and final project at General Assembly I chose to create a scheduling app for use by hairstylists(My amazing wife Amanda is one). Few solutions exist that also allow client information to be stored and easily retrieved

### Future improvements

The following list are some objectives that I would like to work on next:

* Basic user log in (Add authentication in future version)
* Complete CRUD for stylists and clients
* Add feature for use by clients to see upcoming appointments
* User friendly formatting of displayed time and dates
* Improve overall styling

### What I Learned

I chose to try my hand at automatic testing on this project. This experience made me realize the time that goes in to writing good tests and how beneficial the red, green, refactor cycle is in staying productive and saving time on manually testing. 

Eventually I had to decide to leave testing alone in order to keep on track with the project timeline. 

I took my own advice from my previous project and planned more thoroughly and wrote my user stories in a more specific way that a team would be able to understand.
I spent more time on my wireframes going from hand drawn to using Balsamiq Mockups

I approached my time coding from a different perspective this project. Rather than choose to use a familiar solution that I had used on previous projects I challenged myself by finding a different solution. By doing this, I gained a deeper understanding of the technologies I used.

Due to the time spent on testing and planning, I couldn't afford to take as much time working through an issue or bug on my own. Asking for help from my classmates and instructor when needed was very helpful in using the time I had left effectively.
